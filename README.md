# DeathSwap
A fun minigame to play with a friend!

 - Put the plugin into your plugins folder
 - Then start/restart the server
 - Ta da, you're done!

## How to play?
Deathswap is a game where two players duke it out, trying to be the last one alive! Play begins with both players starting a fresh survival experience, thousands of blocks apart.
Every 5 minutes, the players will switch positions. The aim is to put yourself in a position that would result in your opponent's death, should a swap occur. It's that easy! Try to kill your opponent with a simple trap, like holding shift over lava, or with something more intricate... like pressure plates and TNT!

I suggest that you use a plugin like PureEntitiesX so you can have mobs spawn around you if not then you automatically start with a stack of cooked beef in your hotbar.
